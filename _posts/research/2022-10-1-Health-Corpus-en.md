## Project Significance:
1.	Analyzing changes in news discourse on China's foreign health assistance
China's foreign health development assistance is an important component of China's foreign aid and a demonstration of China's fulfillment of international obligations and its strength as a major power. Establishing a foreign health assistance corpus can provide rich materials for research on changes in news discourse regarding China's foreign health assistance, further strengthening the discourse system construction of a community of common health for mankind.
2.	Providing foundational resources and analytical tools for scholars with similar research needs
Database resources in the specialized field of diplomacy are very limited. This corpus not only provides comprehensive data support and analytical tools for the field of health diplomacy, but also attempts to offer a unique perspective for exploring China's participation in global governance and the development of China's multilateral diplomacy. It can also provide a quantitative research approach for discourse system construction and promote the development of China's international communication.

## Resources:
1.	Diachronic news from People's Daily between 1945-2022
2.	Health assistance sub-corpus
3.	WHO news reports related to China


## Corpus Analysis Tools V1.0:
1. Basic Corpus Functions

  	a.	Word frequency and high-frequency word statistics: Counts the top n (n can be set by users) most frequently occurring words in the corpus and returns the corresponding high-frequency words and their occurrence counts.
  	b.	Keyword analysis: Users can view health diplomacy keywords for specific years by specifying a year.
  	c.	Keyword-in-context analysis: Users can view the contextual environment of a word by entering a keyword. For example, entering "epidemic prevention" retrieves the context around "epidemic prevention" in health diplomacy reports.
  	d.	Collocation analysis: Users can view the collocations before and after a word by entering a keyword. For example, entering "provide" retrieves the subjects, objects, and other words that collocate with it.




2. Diplomacy-Specific Research
    a.	Diplomatic object recognition: Processed corpus data can annotate diplomatic objects, and users can view changes in China's health diplomacy objects by entering a specified time period.
    b.	Bilateral and multilateral cooperation analysis: Through entity co-occurrence relationships, users can obtain the closeness of cooperation between China and different countries and international organizations by entering a specified time period.



## Development Plan:

1. Corpus collection (December 1, 2022)

2. Corpus analysis tool development
    December 10: Improve front-end functional interface, complete front-end and back-end data connection;
    December 15: Enable access to existing interfaces and use of basic functions.
