## 技术写作课程设计

由深圳技术大学质量学院委托，借鉴北京大学技术写作课程的设置，以及国内外兄弟院校的培养体系，为深圳技术大学理工科学生打造一门专属的《技术写作》课程，从而提升学生的写作能力。

**任务：**

1. 学生背景访谈
2. 德国应用类大学的类似课程
3. 课程大纲设计
4. 课程师资咨询
5. 中国标准化协会技术写作能力证书的实施

### 课程背景

工程师在日常工作中常常需要撰写大量技术文档，例如技术报告、技术方案、产品描述、使用教程，发布说明、技术论文等。这类信息通常较为复杂，如何进行复杂信息的写作，从而便于受众能够准确理解常常为工程师所忽略，以为只要自己的工作扎实，按照自己喜欢的方式写完，读者便可理解。然而实际并非如此，好的研究和好的工作，也需要采取恰当与合适的方式进行报告，才能有有效沟通，完成自己的写作目的。

研究这个领域的学科就是"技术写作(technical writing)"，其核心就是以读者为中心，对技术信息化繁为简，从而便于读者理解和使用。近年来清华大学等理工科学校纷纷开设写作课，提高学生的写作能力。

科技领域的国际交往逐渐频繁，当今工程师通常需要良好的双语写作能力，从而能有效与国际同行沟通交流，促进理解与合作。然而技术英文与普通英文写作有较大的不同，也需要专门训练才能撰写出精确、简明和便于理解的英文。

### 课程目标

1. 教会理工科学生技术写作的基本原理与方法，能创作简明易懂的技术内容；
2. 熟悉常用技术文体，并基于模板创作高质量文档；
3. 掌握技术英文的写作规范；
4. 有跨文化沟通的意识，能使用双语进行技术交流 (technical communication)

## Technical Writing Course Design

Commissioned by the College of Quality at Shenzhen Technology University, this project draws on the technical writing curriculum at Peking University as well as training systems from peer institutions both domestically and internationally, to create a dedicated "Technical Writing" course for science and engineering students at Shenzhen Technology University, thereby enhancing their writing skills.

**Tasks:**

1. Student background interviews
2. Similar courses at German universities of applied sciences
3. Course syllabus design
4. Faculty consulting
5. Implementation of the China Association for Standardization technical writing competency certificate

### Course Background

Engineers frequently need to write a large volume of technical documents in their daily work, such as technical reports, technical proposals, product descriptions, user tutorials, release notes, and technical papers. This type of information is usually quite complex. How to write about complex information so that the audience can accurately understand it is often overlooked by engineers, who assume that as long as their work is solid and they write in their preferred style, readers will understand. However, this is not the case in reality. Good research and good work also require appropriate and suitable methods of reporting to achieve effective communication and fulfill the writing purpose.

The discipline that studies this field is "technical writing," whose core principle is to be reader-centered, simplifying complex technical information to make it easier for readers to understand and use. In recent years, science and engineering universities such as Tsinghua University have been offering writing courses to improve students' writing skills.

International interactions in the field of science and technology are becoming increasingly frequent. Today's engineers typically need strong bilingual writing skills to effectively communicate and collaborate with international peers. However, technical English differs significantly from general English writing and also requires specialized training to produce precise, concise, and comprehensible English.

### Course Objectives

1. Teach science and engineering students the fundamental principles and methods of technical writing, enabling them to create clear and understandable technical content;
2. Familiarize students with common technical document types and create high-quality documents based on templates;
3. Master the conventions of technical English writing;
4. Develop cross-cultural communication awareness and the ability to conduct technical communication bilingually
