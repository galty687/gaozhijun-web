## Developer Documentation Experience Research

Developer documentation plays a vital role in the software development process. From software installation to troubleshooting, development work can hardly proceed without documentation. Current user-centered design philosophies primarily focus on end users, with fewer attempts to design the development experience centered on developers. This research attempts to improve the development experience from the perspective of documentation experience, thereby fostering developer loyalty to development technologies through a positive information experience.

## Research Team:

- Zhijun Gao
- Jiangying Wang
- Jincheng Huang
- Wenxi Du

## Research Questions:

- What are the characteristics of Chinese developers?
- What types of software development documentation exist?
- What does the developer's information journey look like?
- How to design the documentation experience?
- How to evaluate documentation quality?
