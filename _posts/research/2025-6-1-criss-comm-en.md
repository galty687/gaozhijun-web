## Project Source

A project under the "Humanities and Social Sciences Project Cluster" of the Peking University - East Lake High-Tech Zone National Intelligent Social Governance Experimental Base.

Project Title: Research on Regional Holistic Health Governance and Public Emergency Opinion Guidance Mechanisms Based on Large Language Models and Data Intelligence -- A Case Study of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Zone

Project Funding: 400,000 RMB

## Sub-project

Sub-project Title: Building an AI Agent for Public Opinion Guidance in Local Public Emergencies

Agent Functions:

1. Real-time detection of public emergencies on the internet for specific county/district-level areas (e.g., Wuhan East Lake District);
2. Real-time tracking of public emergency evolution (post count, repost volume, voice growth rate, geographic spread, media involvement, trending index, sentiment stance, rumor risk, KOL influence, etc.)
3. Dynamically generate risk assessment cards based on the evolution of public opinion, and define levels of opinion intervention
4. Generate opinion guidance resource packages based on intervention levels (initial press releases, FAQs, rumor-debunking cards, popular science videos, etc.)
5. Continuously track the effectiveness of opinion guidance and dynamically adjust guidance measures (such as increasing the frequency of information disclosure, etc.)

## Deliverables

1. AI Agent: A cloud-deployed, operational system
2. Documentation: Deployment Manual, Operations & Maintenance Manual, API Integration Documentation
